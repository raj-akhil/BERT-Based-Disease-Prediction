# BERT-Based-Disease-Prediction
Recent advancements in healthcare, especially the use of electronic health records, have shown the potential to implement
machine learning and deep learning-based methods in the healthcare field. These advancements can contribute to the
improvement of treatments and early disease detection helping various patients with chronic disorders. Numerous
studies have been done in the healthcare domain, such as BEHRT and Med-Bert, harnessing the power of AI-driven
approaches. In this particular study, the prediction of diagnoses utilizing UK Biobank data was undertaken. This
was achieved by developing four distinct methods with BERT serving as the base model. With the help of additional
parameters such as age and gender, along with specialized techniques, the predictive capabilities of these methods were
notably enhanced. The model with a precision score of 0.41 and an AUROC score of 0.89 has been chosen out of
four models by comparing different factors. The resulting embedding diagram from this selected model is examined,
revealing its capacity to capture diverse relationships among diagnoses within the respiratory, cardiovascular, and
neural disorders, and other domains along with gender-based conditions. Additionally, the need for a modified masking
strategy, and how it affects the training procedure is discussed and analysed. The selected model is deployed using
Flask API for interacting with the model easily. This study shows the potential of advanced AI-driven methodologies in
healthcare, offering valuable insights into disease prediction and medical treatments.
